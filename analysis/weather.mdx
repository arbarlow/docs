## Weather Analysis

Stride provides comprehensive weather integration to help you understand how the weather affects your performance and to plan races etc

## Key Weather Metrics

### Wind Analysis

#### Apparent Wind Direction
See the combined effect of actual wind and your movement speed. The radial chart shows:
- **Headwind**: Wind coming directly at you 
- **Tailwind**: Wind from behind 
- **Crosswind**: Wind from the side 

The percentage breakdown helps you understand time spent in each wind condition during your ride.

#### General Wind Direction
View the actual wind patterns from weather stations along your route, displayed on a compass rose showing:
- Prevailing wind direction
- Wind strength indicators
- Geographic wind patterns

### Real-time Conditions

During your activities, Stride tracks:
- **Temperature**: Current temperature readings
- **Wind Speed**: Measured in km/h or mph
- **Wind Direction**: Compass bearing (e.g., 298Â° NW)
- **Elevation**: Current altitude and accumulated gain

### Performance Impact

The weather overlay shows how conditions affected your performance:
- Time spent at each apparent wind angle
- Percentage of time with wind from each compass direction
- Elevation profile with weather conditions mapped to specific segments

## Using Weather Data

1. **Post-ride Analysis**: Review how headwinds affected your power output and speed
2. **Route Planning**: Choose routes that minimize headwind exposure on key efforts
3. **Performance Context**: Understand why certain segments felt harder than usual

## Future Weather Planning

### Import Strava Routes

Stride offers powerful weather forecasting for planning future rides and races:

1. **Drag and Drop Import**: Simply drag a Strava route directly onto your Stride calendar from the side bar
2. **Instant Weather Forecast**: View predicted weather conditions for that specific route
3. **Time Optimization**: Adjust the activity start time to see how weather changes throughout the day

### Planning Features

#### Race Day Strategy
- Import your race course weeks in advance
- Monitor weather forecasts as race day approaches
- Experiment with different start times to find optimal conditions
- Plan pacing strategy based on expected wind directions

#### Training Ride Planning
- Check weather before committing to a long ride
- Plan clothing and nutrition based on temperature forecasts
- Find a tailwind home!

#### Dynamic Time Adjustment
Simply drag the activity to different time slots to instantly see:
- Updated temperature predictions
- Changed wind speeds and directions
- Precipitation probability
- Overall condition suitability

This feature is particularly valuable for:
- **Time trialists**: Finding minimal wind conditions
- **Ultra-distance riders**: Planning around temperature extremes
- **Group ride leaders**: Selecting safe conditions for club rides
- **Event organizers**: Scheduling optimal start times

This helps you visualize exactly where and when you'll encounter specific conditions, allowing for strategic planning of efforts and pacing.
