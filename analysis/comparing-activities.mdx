## Why Compare Activities?

Comparing activities helps you:
- Track fitness improvements
- Evaluate pacing strategies
- Test equipment changes
- Understand environmental impacts
- Refine race tactics

## Types of Comparisons

### Same Route Comparison

Most valuable for tracking progress:

**What to Compare**:
- Overall time
- Power on key segments
- Heart rate response
- Perceived effort
- Weather conditions

**Example Analysis**:
```
March 1st: 1:45:00, 245W avg, 155bpm
April 15th: 1:42:30, 255W avg, 150bpm
Improvement: 2:30 faster, 10W more power, 5bpm lower HR
```

### Workout Comparison

Track interval progression:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Week 1">
    5x5min @ FTP
    - Interval avg: 285W, 287W, 283W, 280W, 275W
    - Fade: 3.5%
    - Avg HR: 165bpm
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Week 4">
    5x5min @ FTP
    - Interval avg: 295W, 294W, 293W, 292W, 290W
    - Fade: 1.7%
    - Avg HR: 162bpm
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Improvements Shown**:
- 10W higher average (+3.5%)
- Better consistency (less fade)
- Lower HR (improved efficiency)

## Key Metrics to Compare

### Performance Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Average Power">
    Overall effort level - higher is generally better
  </Card>
  <Card title="Normalized Power">
    Accounts for variability - better for varied terrain
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variability Index">
    How steady - lower better for TTs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency Factor">
    Power per heartbeat - higher shows fitness
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Time-Based Metrics

**Segment Times**:
- Climbs
- Technical sections
- Sprint points
- Overall splits

**Power Duration**:
- Best 20-minute power
- Time above threshold
- Sprint repeatability

## Environmental Factors

### Weather Impact

Always note conditions:

| Factor | Power Impact | Speed Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| 10mph headwind | +20-30W | -2-3mph |
| 10mph tailwind | -15-20W | +2-3mph |
| 10Â°C colder | +5-10W | Minimal |
| Rain | +10-15W | -1-2mph |
| Altitude 2000m | -10-15% | Varies |

### Equipment Changes

Track impact of:
- New wheels (aerodynamics)
- Different tires (rolling resistance)
- Position changes (aerodynamics)
- Bike weight (climbing)
- Clothing (aerodynamics)

<Info>
  **Testing Tip**: Only change one variable at a time to accurately measure impact.
</Info>

## Race Performance Analysis

### Pre-Race vs Race Day

Compare your race to training:

**Training Ride**:
- Controlled effort
- Steady power
- Conservative pacing
- No pressure

**Race Day**:
- Variable power
- Higher peaks
- Adrenaline factor
- Better performance?

### Post-Race Review

Questions to answer:
1. Did I pace correctly?
2. Where did I lose/gain time?
3. How did power compare to plan?
4. What would I do differently?

## Group Ride Analysis

### Comparing Efforts

Same group ride, different weeks:

**Metrics to Track**:
- Time in draft vs pulling
- Number of efforts > FTP
- Recovery between efforts
- Overall Training Score

### Position Impact

Compare when you:
- Sat in vs animated
- Different group sizes
- Various routes
- Weather conditions

## Testing Protocols

### A/B Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Equipment Testing">
    1. Same route, same day
    2. Alternate equipment
    3. Control all other variables
    4. Multiple runs for accuracy
    5. Compare power and speed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Position Testing">
    1. Use trainer or velodrome
    2. Fixed power output
    3. Measure speed/HR
    4. Test one position change
    5. Allow adaptation time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Nutrition Testing">
    1. Identical workouts
    2. Different fueling strategies
    3. Track power sustainability
    4. Note perceived effort
    5. Monitor recovery
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Long-Term Comparisons

### Seasonal Changes

Compare same months year-over-year:

**Spring Build**:
- Year 1: 250W FTP, 65 Load
- Year 2: 265W FTP, 72 Load  
- Year 3: 275W FTP, 78 Load

Shows consistent improvement!

### Breakthrough Performances

Identify when you level up:
- Sudden power increases
- HR efficiency improvements
- New duration capabilities
- Mental breakthroughs

## Creating Comparison Reports

### Monthly Comparison

Create a standard monthly test:
1. Same 1-hour route
2. Best sustainable effort
3. Consistent conditions
4. Track key metrics
5. Chart progression

### Export Options

Share comparisons:
- PDF reports
- CSV data export
- Image snapshots
- Public links (optional)

## Advanced Analysis

### Statistical Comparison

Beyond simple averages:
- Standard deviation (consistency)
- Percentile analysis
- Correlation factors
- Regression analysis

### Machine Learning Insights

Stride identifies:
- Similar untagged efforts
- Performance predictors
- Optimal conditions
- Training recommendations

<Warning>
  Don't over-analyze! Sometimes a bad day is just a bad day. Look for patterns over multiple comparisons.
</Warning>

## Practical Applications

### Using Comparisons for Goals

**Example - Improve Climbing**:
1. Identify key local climb
2. Test monthly
3. Compare power/time
4. Track W/kg improvements
5. Adjust training based on results

### Race Preparation

Compare efforts at race power:
- How long can you hold it?
- How does HR respond?
- Can you repeat it?
- Recovery between efforts?

## Common Comparison Mistakes

### Avoid These Errors

1. **Ignoring conditions** - Weather matters!
2. **Different equipment** - Changes results
3. **Fatigue levels** - Fresh vs tired
4. **Time of day** - Morning vs evening
5. **Nutrition status** - Fasted vs fueled
