## Tracking Your Progress

Consistent progress tracking helps you understand if your training is working and where to make adjustments. Stride provides multiple tools to monitor improvements.

## Fitness Trends

### Load Progression

Your primary fitness indicator over time:

**What to Look For**:
- **Steady increase**: 3-5 points/week is sustainable
- **Plateaus**: May need more stimulus
- **Drops**: Planned (taper) or unplanned (missed training)

**Viewing Options**:
- 6 week trend (micro view)
- 3 month progression (training block)
- Annual overview (seasons)
- Multi-year (long-term development)

### Fatigue Patterns

Track your readiness cycles:

**Healthy Patterns**:
- Regular oscillation between -20 and 0
- Peaks before target events
- No chronic deep negative form

**Warning Signs**:
- Always negative form (overtraining)
- Always positive (undertraining)
- No variation (monotonous training)

## Power Progression

### Power Records Chart

See improvements across all durations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sprint Power">
    **5-15 seconds**
    - Track max power improvements
    - Usually improves with specific training
    - Compare in-season vs off-season
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Anaerobic">
    **1-2 minutes**
    - Critical for attacks and short climbs
    - Responds quickly to training
    - Watch for plateau after 6-8 weeks
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="VO2 Max">
    **3-8 minutes**
    - Key predictor of performance
    - Slower to improve than anaerobic
    - Best gains in build phase
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Threshold">
    **20-60 minutes**
    - Your FTP indicator
    - Steady improvements expected
    - 2-3% monthly gains when building
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Power Trends Graph

Track specific durations over time:
1. Select duration (e.g., 20 minutes)
2. Choose time period
3. View progression line
4. Identify breakthrough performances

**Expected Improvements**:
- Beginners: 10-20% in first year
- Intermediate: 5-10% annually
- Advanced: 2-5% annually
- Elite: 1-2% (marginal gains)

  <Card title="FTP History">
    - Test results over time
    - W/kg progression
    - Seasonal variations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Comparing Time Periods

### Season Comparison

Compare different training phases:

**Base vs Build**:
- Load: Higher in base
- Intensity: Higher in build
- Load progression: Steadier in base
- Power improvements: Faster in build

**Year-over-Year**:
- Same period comparisons
- Account for life changes
- Look for consistent patterns
- Identify what worked

### Monthly Reviews

End of each month, review:
1. **Total Training Score**: Hit targets?
2. **Load change**: +10-20 expected
3. **Power improvements**: Any PRs?
4. **Consistency**: Missing days?
5. **Feeling**: Fatigue appropriate?

### Breaking Through

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Training Changes">
    - Add new stimulus (different intervals)
    - Increase volume 10-15%
    - Add strength training
    - Change terrain/routes
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Recovery Focus">
    - Take a recovery week
    - Improve sleep quality
    - Address nutrition gaps
    - Reduce life stress
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Testing Issues">
    - Retest in better conditions
    - Check power meter calibration
    - Ensure proper warm-up
    - Test at consistent times
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Long-Term Development

### Annual Planning

Track year-long patterns:

**Typical Annual Progression**:
1. **Off-season** (Nov-Dec): Maintenance
2. **Base** (Jan-Mar): Volume build
3. **Build** (Apr-May): Intensity focus
4. **Peak** (Jun-Jul): Race performance
5. **Mid-season** (Aug-Sep): Maintain
6. **Late season** (Oct): Final events

### Multi-Year View

**Year 1-2**: Rapid improvements (10-20%)
**Year 3-5**: Steady gains (5-10%)
**Year 5+**: Marginal gains (1-5%)

Focus shifts from raw power to:
- Efficiency
- Durability
- Tactical execution
- Mental strength

<Info>
  **Remember**: Progress isn't always linear. Expect ups and downs, but the long-term trend should be upward.
</Info>

## Common Tracking Mistakes

### Avoid These Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring context** - Weather, fatigue, life stress matter
2. **Chasing every metric** - Focus on 2-3 key ones
3. **Comparing to others** - Your progression matters most
4. **Expecting linear gains** - Plateaus are normal
