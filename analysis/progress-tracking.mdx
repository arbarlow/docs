## Tracking Your Progress

Consistent progress tracking helps you understand if your training is working and where to make adjustments. Stride provides multiple tools to monitor improvements.

## Fitness Trends

### Load Progression

Your primary fitness indicator over time:

**What to Look For**:
- **Steady increase**: 3-5 points/week is sustainable
- **Plateaus**: May need more stimulus
- **Drops**: Planned (taper) or unplanned (missed training)

**Viewing Options**:
- 6 week trend (micro view)
- 3 month progression (training block)
- Annual overview (seasons)
- Multi-year (long-term development)

### Form Patterns

Track your readiness cycles:

**Healthy Patterns**:
- Regular oscillation between -20 and 0
- Peaks before target events
- No chronic deep negative form

**Warning Signs**:
- Always negative form (overtraining)
- Always positive (undertraining)
- No variation (monotonous training)

## Power Progression

### Power Records Chart

See improvements across all durations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sprint Power">
    **5-15 seconds**
    - Track max power improvements
    - Usually improves with specific training
    - Compare in-season vs off-season
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Anaerobic">
    **1-2 minutes**
    - Critical for attacks and short climbs
    - Responds quickly to training
    - Watch for plateau after 6-8 weeks
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="VO2 Max">
    **3-8 minutes**
    - Key predictor of performance
    - Slower to improve than anaerobic
    - Best gains in build phase
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Threshold">
    **20-60 minutes**
    - Your FTP indicator
    - Steady improvements expected
    - 2-3% monthly gains when building
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Power Trends Graph

Track specific durations over time:
1. Select duration (e.g., 20 minutes)
2. Choose time period
3. View progression line
4. Identify breakthrough performances

**Expected Improvements**:
- Beginners: 10-20% in first year
- Intermediate: 5-10% annually
- Advanced: 2-5% annually
- Elite: 1-2% (marginal gains)

    - Test results over time
    - W/kg progression
    - Seasonal variations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency Factor">
    - Power/HR relationship
    - Improving = fitter
    - Track on similar efforts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Power Duration">
    - Time at threshold
    - Increasing = better endurance
    - Key for long events
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repeatability">
    - Interval consistency
    - Less fade = better fitness
    - Critical for racing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Comparing Time Periods

### Season Comparison

Compare different training phases:

**Base vs Build**:
- Volume: Higher in base
- Intensity: Higher in build
- Load progression: Steadier in base
- Power improvements: Faster in build

**Year-over-Year**:
- Same period comparisons
- Account for life changes
- Look for consistent patterns
- Identify what worked

### Monthly Reviews

End of each month, review:
1. **Total Training Score**: Hit targets?
2. **Load change**: +10-20 expected
3. **Power improvements**: Any PRs?
4. **Consistency**: Missing days?
5. **Feeling**: Fatigue appropriate?

## Setting Benchmarks

### Test Protocol

Regular testing ensures accurate tracking:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FTP Test Schedule">
    - Start of season (baseline)
    - Every 6-8 weeks in build
    - Before key events
    - After extended breaks
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Power Profile Test">
    Complete efforts at:
    - 5 seconds (sprint)
    - 1 minute (anaerobic)
    - 5 minutes (VO2)
    - 20 minutes (threshold)
    All in one session or spread over a week
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Repeatability Test">
    - 5 x 3 minutes at 110% FTP
    - 3 minutes recovery between
    - Track power fade across intervals
    - Improvement = less fade
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Goal Setting

### SMART Goals

Make goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound:

❌ "Get stronger"
✅ "Increase FTP from 250W to 270W by June 1st"

❌ "Ride more"  
✅ "Average 8 hours/week for next 8 weeks"

### Progress Milestones

Break big goals into checkpoints:

**Example - Increase FTP 20W**:
- Week 4: +5W (test)
- Week 8: +10W (test)
- Week 12: +15W (test)
- Week 16: +20W (final test)

## Identifying Plateaus

### Signs of a Plateau

- Power numbers stagnant 4+ weeks
- Same workout feels harder
- Form chronically negative
- Motivation dropping

### Breaking Through

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Training Changes">
    - Add new stimulus (different intervals)
    - Increase volume 10-15%
    - Add strength training
    - Change terrain/routes
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Recovery Focus">
    - Take a recovery week
    - Improve sleep quality
    - Address nutrition gaps
    - Reduce life stress
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Testing Issues">
    - Retest in better conditions
    - Check power meter calibration
    - Ensure proper warm-up
    - Test at consistent times
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Long-Term Development

### Annual Planning

Track year-long patterns:

**Typical Annual Progression**:
1. **Off-season** (Nov-Dec): Maintenance
2. **Base** (Jan-Mar): Volume build
3. **Build** (Apr-May): Intensity focus
4. **Peak** (Jun-Jul): Race performance
5. **Mid-season** (Aug-Sep): Maintain
6. **Late season** (Oct): Final events

### Multi-Year View

**Year 1-2**: Rapid improvements (10-20%)
**Year 3-5**: Steady gains (5-10%)
**Year 5+**: Marginal gains (1-5%)

Focus shifts from raw power to:
- Efficiency
- Durability
- Tactical execution
- Mental strength

## Using Data Effectively

### Weekly Check-ins

Every Sunday, review:
- Weekly Training Score vs plan
- Load trend (building appropriately?)
- Any breakthrough performances
- How you felt vs numbers

### Monthly Deep Dive

First weekend of month:
- Export data for analysis
- Compare to previous months
- Identify successful patterns
- Adjust upcoming plans

### Quarterly Reviews

Every 3 months:
- Formal testing
- Goal reassessment  
- Training plan adjustments
- Equipment evaluation

<Info>
  **Remember**: Progress isn't always linear. Expect ups and downs, but the long-term trend should be upward.
</Info>

## Common Tracking Mistakes

### Avoid These Pitfalls

1. **Testing too often** - Monthly maximum
2. **Ignoring context** - Weather, fatigue, life stress matter
3. **Chasing every metric** - Focus on 2-3 key ones
4. **Comparing to others** - Your progression matters most
5. **Expecting linear gains** - Plateaus are normal
