## Auto-Sync from Devices

### How Auto-Sync Works

Once connected, activities flow automatically:

1. **Complete activity** on your device
2. **Save and upload** to Garmin Connect/Wahoo
3. **Stride syncs** within 5-15 minutes
4. **Processing** adds metrics and analysis
5. **Notification** when ready to view

### Sync Status Indicators

In your activity list:
- üîÑ **Syncing**: Currently importing
- ‚úÖ **Synced**: Successfully imported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Partial data
- ‚ùå **Error**: Sync failed

### Troubleshooting Sync

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Activity Not Appearing">
    1. Check device uploaded to Garmin/Wahoo
    2. Verify integration is connected
    3. Wait 15 minutes (can be delayed)
    4. Force sync from dashboard
    5. Re-authorize if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Data">
    Common causes:
    - Sensors not paired during ride
    - Device didn't record all streams
    - File corrupted during upload

2. **Heart Rate** (backup metric)
3. **GPS** (for mapping/segments)
4. **Cadence** (for efficiency)
5. **Temperature** (context)

### Activity Naming

Good naming helps organization:
- ‚ùå "Morning Ride"
- ‚úÖ "Tempo Intervals - River Loop"
- ‚úÖ "FTP Test - 20min"
- ‚úÖ "Recovery Spin - Post Race"

## Privacy Settings

Control who sees your activities:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Public">
    - Visible to all Stride users
    - Shows in team feeds
    - Appears in segments
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Team Only">

    - Hidden from public
    - Coach can see (if applicable)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Private">
    - Only you can see
    - Excluded from leaderboards
    - Still counts for your metrics
