## Auto-Sync from Devices

### How Auto-Sync Works

Once connected, activities flow automatically:

1. **Complete activity** on your device
2. **Save and upload** to Garmin Connect/Wahoo
3. **Stride syncs** within a few minutes
4. **Processing** adds metrics and analysis
5. **Notification** when ready to view

### Troubleshooting Sync

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Activity Not Appearing">
    1. Check device uploaded to Garmin/Wahoo
    2. Verify integration is connected
    3. Wait 15 minutes (can be delayed)
    4. Re-authorize if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Data">
    Common causes:
    - File corrupted during upload
    - Integration permissions changed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Activities">
    If you see duplicates:
    - Check you haven't uploaded manually too
    - Disable one integration if using multiple
    - Delete duplicate (keeps the best data)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Manual File Upload

### Supported File Types

| Format | Extension | Contains | Best For |

| ZIP | .zip | All data | Modern devices |

### Common Upload Issues

**File Problems**:
- **Corrupted file**: Try exporting again
- **Missing data**: Check original recording

## Manual Entry

For when you don't have a file:

### Basic Information

Required fields:
- **Date & Time**: When you started
- **Duration**: Total time
- **Activity Type**: Ride, run, etc.

### When to Use Manual Entry

- Forgot to record
- Device failed
- Borrowed bike/equipment
- Group rides without your device
- Trainer without connectivity

## Best Practices

### For Quality Data

1. **Calibrate sensors** before important rides
2. **Start recording** before moving
3. **Check connections** in first minute
4. **Keep device charged** for long rides
5. **Save immediately** after finishing

### Data Completeness

Priority data streams:
1. **Power** (most important for cycling)
2. **Heart Rate** (backup metric)
3. **GPS** (for mapping/segments)
4. **Cadence** (for efficiency)
5. **Temperature** (context)
