## Zone Distribution

### Power Zones

See time spent in each zone:

- Target zone: 20-30%
- Recovery: 40-50%
- Other: 20-30%

## Interval Analysis

### Automatic Detection

Stride identifies intervals based on:
- Power patterns
- Sustained efforts
- Rest periods
- Workout structure

### Interval Details

For each interval:
- Average power
- Normalized power
- Duration
- Variability Index
- Achievement of target

### Comparing Intervals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Within Workout">
    See if you maintained power across sets:
    - Interval 1: 285W
    - Interval 2: 282W (-1%)
    - Interval 3: 278W (-3%)
    - Shows good pacing!
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Across Workouts">
    Track progression over time:
    - 4 weeks ago: 270W average
    - 2 weeks ago: 278W average
    - Today: 285W average
    - Clear improvement!
  </Tab>

## Power Curves

### Activity Power Curve

Your best power for every duration in THIS ride:
- Sprint power (1-15 seconds)
- Anaerobic (30s - 2 min)
- VO2 max (3-8 min)
- Threshold (20-60 min)

### Comparing to Your Best

Options to overlay:
- Last 30 days best
- Last 90 days best
- Season best
- All-time best

**Reading the Comparison**:
- üü¢ Above previous best (new record!)
- üü° Within 5% of best
- üîµ Normal performance
- üî¥ Significantly below (fatigue?)

## Advanced Metrics

### Normalized Power (NP)

Why it matters:
- Better represents metabolic cost
- Accounts for variability
- Used for IF calculation

**NP vs Average Power**:
- Steady ride: NP ‚âà Average
- Variable ride: NP > Average
- Very punchy: NP >> Average

### Variability Index (VI)

VI = Normalized Power √∑ Average Power

**Interpreting VI**:
- 1.00-1.05: Very steady (TT, trainer)
- 1.05-1.15: Normal road ride
- 1.15-1.25: Variable (group, hills)
- >1.25: Very stochastic (crits, attacks)

### Efficiency Factor (EF)

EF = Normalized Power √∑ Average HR

**Tracking EF**:
- Higher = more efficient
- Track over similar efforts
- Indicates fitness gains
- Account for conditions

## Segments & Achievements

### Segment Matching

Stride automatically finds:
- Strava segments (if connected)
- Popular local climbs
- Your previous efforts
- Leaderboard positions

### Personal Records

Highlighted achievements:
- ‚≠ê Power PRs (5s, 1min, 5min, 20min)
- üèîÔ∏è Climbing PRs (VAM, elevation)
- üöÄ Speed records
- üí™ Longest effort at threshold

## Environmental Factors

### Weather Data

Automatically captured:
- Temperature
- Wind speed/direction
- Humidity
- Calculated impact on performance

### Elevation Profile

Interactive elevation chart:
- Gradient coloring
- Power overlay
- Speed changes
- Key climbs marked

<Warning>
  Weather can significantly impact power. A headwind can add 20-50W to maintain the same speed!
</Warning>

## Using Analysis for Improvement

### What to Look For

**Good Execution**:
- Even power across intervals
- Hit target zones
- Appropriate VI for workout type
- Power/HR tracking together

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Power fading in later intervals
- Too much time in wrong zones
- VI too high for goal
- HR not responding (overtraining?)

### Action Items

After each key workout:
1. ‚úÖ Did I hit my targets?
2. üìà Any new power records?
3. üí≠ How did it feel vs numbers?
4. üìù What to adjust next time?

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Add notes while the ride is fresh. Include RPE, nutrition, sleep quality - context that numbers don't capture.
</Info>

## Quick Analysis Tips

### Time-Saving Shortcuts

- **Spacebar**: Play/pause data replay
- **Arrow keys**: Jump between intervals
- **Shift+Drag**: Measure any section
- **Double-click**: Reset zoom

### Key Questions

For every activity, ask:
1. Did I achieve the workout's purpose?
2. What does this tell me about my fitness?
3. What should I do differently next time?
