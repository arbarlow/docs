## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What devices work with Stride?">
    Stride works with:
    - **Garmin**: All cycling computers and watches
    - **Wahoo**: All ELEMNT devices
    - **Whoop**: For recovery data
    - **Mobile**: iOS and Android apps

    See [Connecting Devices](/getting-started/connecting-devices) for setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a power meter?">
    No, but it's highly recommended for cycling. Power provides:
    - Accurate training zones
    - Precise Training Score
    - Better workout execution
    - Performance tracking
    
    You can use heart rate as an alternative, though it's less precise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between free and paid plans?">
    **Free Plan**:
    - 3 months of history
    - Basic metrics
    - Manual uploads
    - Mobile app
    
    **Premium Plan** ($14.99/mo):
    - Unlimited history
    - Advanced analytics
    - Training plans
    - Workout builder
    - Device sync
    
    See [Billing](/account/billing) for full comparison.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import my historical data?">
    Yes! When you connect:
    - **Garmin**: Imports last 2 years
    - **Wahoo**: Imports available history
    - **Files**: Upload old .FIT files
    - **Strava**: No activity import (only sends to Strava)
    
    Bulk upload supported for switching platforms.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Training Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Training Score?">
    Training Score (TS) measures the training stress of a single workout based on:
    - Duration
    - Intensity (relative to your FTP)
    - Your fitness level
    
    Think of 100 TS as roughly 1 hour at threshold. See [Training Score](/concepts/training-score) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Load and CTL?">
    They're the same concept with different names:
    - **Load** (Stride) = CTL (Training Peaks)
    - Both represent fitness (42-day average)
    - We use "Load" as it's more intuitive
    
    Same for Fatigue (ATL) and Form (TSB).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I test my FTP?">
    Test your FTP:
    - Every 6-8 weeks during build periods
    - Start of each season
    - When workouts feel too easy/hard
    - After 2+ weeks off
    
    Use 20-minute test or ramp test. See [Setting Zones](/getting-started/setting-zones).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is my Form negative?">
    Negative Form is normal and often desirable:
    - **-10 to -20**: Good training load
    - **-20 to -30**: Heavy training block
    - **Below -30**: Risk of overtraining
    
    Positive Form means you're fresh but not building fitness.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Activities & Syncing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why aren't my activities syncing?">
    Common causes:
    1. Device hasn't synced to Garmin/Wahoo first
    2. Integration disconnected
    3. Privacy settings blocking
    4. Server delays (wait 15 min)
    
    See [Troubleshooting](/mobile/troubleshooting) for fixes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit activities after upload?">
    Yes, you can edit:
    - Name and description
    - Activity type
    - Equipment used
    - Privacy settings
    
    You cannot edit:
    - Power/HR data
    - Distance/duration
    - GPS tracks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does Strava integration seem limited?">
    Strava integration is one-way:
    - ✅ Stride uploads TO Strava
    - ❌ Strava doesn't send activities to Stride
    - ✅ Segments and social features work
    
    You need Garmin/Wahoo/Stride app to record activities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I delete duplicate activities?">
    1. Go to Activities list
    2. Click the duplicate
    3. Select **Delete** from menu
    4. Confirm deletion
    
    To prevent: Use only one sync method (not both Garmin + file upload).
