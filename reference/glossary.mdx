## Glossary of Terms

Understanding cycling and training terminology helps you get the most from Stride. Here are the key terms you'll encounter:

## A

**Active Recovery**
Light exercise (50-60% FTP) that promotes recovery by increasing blood flow without adding training stress.

**Aerobic**
Exercise intensity where your body primarily uses oxygen to produce energy. Generally sustainable for long periods.

**Anaerobic**
High-intensity exercise where your body can't supply enough oxygen, relying on stored energy. Only sustainable for short periods.

## B

**Base Phase**
Training period focused on building aerobic fitness through longer, easier rides. Typically 8-12 weeks.

**BPM**
Beats Per Minute - measurement of heart rate.

**Build Phase**
Training period where intensity increases to build race-specific fitness. Follows base phase.

## C

**Cadence**
Pedaling speed measured in RPM (revolutions per minute). Typical range: 80-100 RPM.

**Chainring**
Front gear(s) attached to your cranks. Larger chainring = harder gear.

**Crank**
The arm that connects your pedal to the bike's bottom bracket.

## D

**Domestique**
Team rider who works for others. In training: learning to work hard for the team.

**Drops**
Lower part of drop handlebars. Aerodynamic position for descents or headwinds.

**Duration**
Length of a workout or interval, measured in time or distance.

## E

**Endurance Zone**
Zone 2 training, typically 65-75% of FTP. The foundation of aerobic fitness.

**ERG Mode**
Smart trainer mode that automatically adjusts resistance to maintain target power regardless of speed/gear.

## F


**Fatigue**
In Stride: your short term fatigue. Indicates readiness to perform.

**FTP (Functional Threshold Power)**
The maximum average power you can sustain for approximately one hour. Key metric for setting training zones.

**FTP Test**
Structured workout to determine your FTP. Common protocols: 20-minute test, ramp test.

## G

**Gear Ratio**
Relationship between chainring and cassette sizes. Determines how hard/easy pedaling is.

**GPS**
Global Positioning System - used by devices to track location, speed, and distance.

## H

**Heart Rate Zones**
Training intensities based on percentage of maximum or threshold heart rate.

**HR Max**
Maximum heart rate - the highest your heart can beat. Decreases with age.

**HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**
Variation between heartbeats. Higher HRV often indicates better recovery.

## I

**Intensity**
How hard you're working, measured by power, heart rate, or perceived effort relative to FTP.

**Intervals**
Structured periods of hard effort followed by recovery. Core of many workouts.

## K

**KJ (Kilojoules)**
Unit of work/energy. Roughly equal to calories burned during cycling.

**KOM/QOM**
King/Queen of the Mountain - fastest time on a climb segment.

## L

**Lactate Threshold**
Intensity where lactate accumulates faster than your body can clear it. Close to FTP.

**Load**
Stride's term for Chronic Training Load - your fitness level based on 42-day average Training Score.

## M

**Matchbook**
Burning a "match" means using anaerobic energy for hard efforts. Limited supply per ride.

**Max Power**
Highest power you can produce, typically for 1-5 seconds. Sprint power.

## N

**Neuromuscular Power**
Very short, maximal efforts (under 10 seconds). Sprint training.

## O

**Overreaching**
Planned short-term overload to stimulate adaptation. Requires adequate recovery.

**Overtraining**
Chronic fatigue from too much training without adequate recovery. Avoid this!

## P

**Peak Phase**
Final training phase before key events. Reduced volume, maintained intensity.

**Peloton**
Main group of riders in a race. Also: popular indoor cycling platform.

**Periodization**
Systematic planning of training through different phases (base, build, peak).

**Power Meter**
Device measuring actual power output in watts. Gold standard for training.

**Power-to-Weight Ratio**
Watts per kilogram of body weight. Key metric for climbing performance.

## R

**Recovery**
Time between hard efforts or workouts when adaptation occurs. Critical for improvement.

**Resistance Mode**
Smart trainer mode where resistance increases with speed (simulates real riding).

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)**
Subjective measure of effort intensity, typically 1-10 scale.

**RPM**
Revolutions Per Minute - see Cadence.

## S

**Sweet Spot**
Training at 88-93% of FTP. Balances training stress with sustainability.

**Steady State**
Consistent effort at sustainable intensity. No surges or variations.

## T

**Taper**
Reducing training volume before important events to shed fatigue while maintaining fitness.

**Tempo**
Moderate-hard intensity, typically 76-87% of FTP. "Comfortably hard."

**Threshold**
See FTP. The dividing line between sustainable and unsustainable efforts.

**Training Score (TS)**
Stride's measure of single workout stress. Based on intensity and duration.

## V

**VO2 Max**
Maximum oxygen uptake. Trained at 106-120% of FTP for 3-8 minute intervals.

## W

**Watts**
Unit of power measurement. Direct measure of work being done.

**Watts/kg**
See Power-to-Weight Ratio.

**W' (W-prime)**
Amount of work you can do above FTP before exhaustion. Your "anaerobic battery."

**Workout**
Structured training session with specific intervals and targets.

## Z

**Zone**
Range of intensity for training. Typically many zones from recovery to neuromuscular power.
