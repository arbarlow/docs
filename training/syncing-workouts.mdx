## Understanding Workout Structure

### Power-Based Workouts
Most effective for training with structured intervals:
- **Target Power**: Set as % of FTP or absolute watts
- **Duration**: Time or distance-based intervals
- **Cadence Targets**: Optional RPM guidance

### Workout Elements
1. **Warm-up**: Gradual power increase
2. **Main Set**: Your intervals or steady effort
3. **Cool-down**: Easy spinning to finish

### Example Workout Display
```
Warm-up: 10 min @ 50-65% FTP
Main Set: 
  - 4 x 8 min @ 95% FTP
  - 4 min @ 55% FTP between
Cool-down: 10 min @ 50% FTP
```

## Tips for Successful Workout Execution

### Before You Start
- ‚úÖ Ensure sensors are connected (power, HR, cadence)
- ‚úÖ Calibrate your power meter
- ‚úÖ Check battery levels on all devices
- ‚úÖ For indoor: set trainer to ERG mode

### During the Workout
- üìä Your device will show target power and time remaining
- üîî Audio/visual alerts for interval changes
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Use lap button to pause if needed
- üìà Stay within 5-10 watts of target

### ERG Mode (Indoor)
When connected to a smart trainer:
- Trainer automatically adjusts resistance
- Maintain steady cadence (85-95 rpm typical)
- Don't shift gears - let ERG do the work
- Disable ERG for sprint intervals

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

### Workout Not Appearing

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Garmin">
    1. Check Garmin Connect integration is active
    2. Force sync in Garmin Connect Mobile
    3. Restart your Garmin device
    4. Re-send workout from Stride
    5. Check workout name doesn't contain special characters
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Wahoo">
    1. Verify Wahoo integration is connected
    2. Open ELEMNT app and refresh
    3. Check ELEMNT has latest firmware
    4. Ensure workout is power-based (not HR)
    5. Try removing and re-adding the workout
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Sync Delays
- **Normal sync time**: 2-5 minutes
- **If longer**: Check internet connection
- **Still not working**: Disconnect and reconnect integration

### Power Targets Wrong
- Verify your FTP is set correctly in Stride
- Check device has same FTP value
- Ensure workout was created after last FTP update

## Advanced Features

### Outdoor Workout Mode
For Garmin devices:
- Enable "Target Power Alerts"
- Use 3-second average power
- Account for terrain with wider target ranges

### Creating Device-Specific Workouts
- **Garmin**: Supports complex workouts with HR fallback
- **Wahoo**: Best for simple power-based intervals
- **Both**: Support lap button progressions

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Create simpler workouts for outdoor riding where holding exact power is harder. Use wider target ranges (e.g., 90-100% FTP instead of 95% FTP).
