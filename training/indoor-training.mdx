    ### Manual Resistance Setup
    
    1. **Connect power meter** as your power source
    2. **Connect cadence sensor** if separate
    3. **Set trainer resistance** manually for intervals
    4. **Follow power targets** shown on screen
    
    <Warning>
      Without a smart trainer, you'll need to adjust resistance yourself during intervals
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

### ERG Mode Explained

When using a smart trainer in ERG mode:
- **Automatic Resistance**: Trainer adjusts to maintain target power
- **Cadence Matters**: Keep steady RPM (85-95 typical)
- **Don't Shift**: Let ERG handle the resistance
- **Smooth Pedaling**: Avoid surges or stopping

<Tip>
  **ERG Mode Tip**: If you're struggling to hit power targets, try increasing your cadence slightly. The trainer will reduce resistance to maintain the same power.
</Tip>

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Trainer Won't Connect

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### ERG Mode Not Working

1. **Calibrate your trainer** using manufacturer's app
2. **Check power source** - ensure it's set as "Controllable"
3. **Steady cadence** - ERG needs consistent pedaling
4. **Disable other apps** - only one app can control trainer

### Power Readings Seem Wrong

- **Calibrate trainer** before each ride
- **Check FTP setting** in Stride matches reality
- **Warm up trainer** for 10 minutes before calibrating
- **Compare with power meter** if available

### During the Ride
- üíß Hydrate every 15-20 minutes
- üå°Ô∏è Keep room cool (under 20¬∞C ideal)
- üì± Phone in view but secure
- üéµ Music/entertainment ready
- üßò Focus on smooth pedaling

### Post-Ride
- üíæ Ensure activity synced
- üçî Get your nutrition in

## Advanced Tips

### Optimizing ERG Performance
1. **Find your optimal cadence** - usually 85-95 RPM
2. **Anticipate intervals** - start spinning up 5 seconds early
3. **Smooth transitions** - don't stop pedaling between intervals
4. **Use small ring** - better ERG response for some trainers

### Workout Modifications
- **Too hard?** Reduce workout intensity by 5-10%
- **Too easy?** Increase by 5% or reduce recovery time
- **Time-crunched?** Skip warm-up/cool-down (not recommended regularly)

<Info>
  **Remember**: Consistency beats intensity. Better to complete workouts at 95% than fail at 105%.
