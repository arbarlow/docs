## Following a Structured Workout

### Loading a Workout

<Steps>
  <Step title="From Workout Library">
    - Tap **Workouts** in the app
    - Browse or search for a workout
    - Tap **Start Workout**
  </Step>

  <Step title="From Training Plan">
    - Go to **Today** view

    - Tap **Start** to begin
  </Step>

  <Step title="Workout Preview">
    Review the workout structure:
    - Total duration
    - Interval breakdown
    - Target power zones
  </Step>
</Steps>

### During Your Workout

The Stride app displays:

1. **Current Power** - Real-time wattage
2. **Target Power** - Your goal for this interval (green zone)
3. **Time Remaining** - In current interval and total
4. **Cadence** - Current RPM
5. **Heart Rate** - If sensor connected

### ERG Mode Explained

When using a smart trainer in ERG mode:
- **Automatic Resistance**: Trainer adjusts to maintain target power
- **Cadence Matters**: Keep steady RPM (85-95 typical)
- **Don't Shift**: Let ERG handle the resistance
- **Smooth Pedaling**: Avoid surges or stopping

<Tip>
  **ERG Mode Tip**: If you're struggling to hit power targets, try increasing your cadence slightly. The trainer will reduce resistance to maintain the same power.

</AccordionGroup>

### ERG Mode Not Working

1. **Calibrate your trainer** using manufacturer's app
2. **Check power source** - ensure it's set as "Controllable"
3. **Steady cadence** - ERG needs consistent pedaling
4. **Disable other apps** - only one app can control trainer

### Power Readings Seem Wrong

- **Calibrate trainer** before each ride
- **Check FTP setting** in Stride matches reality
- **Warm up trainer** for 10 minutes before calibrating
- **Compare with power meter** if available

## Best Practices

### Pre-Ride Checklist
- [ ] Trainer firmware updated
- [ ] Phone charged or plugged in
- [ ] Fan positioned correctly
- [ ] Water bottles filled
- [ ] Towel nearby
- [ ] 10-minute warm-up planned

### During the Ride
- 💧 Hydrate every 15-20 minutes
- 🌡️ Keep room cool (65-70°F ideal)
- 📱 Phone in view but secure
- 🎵 Music/entertainment ready
- 🧘 Focus on smooth pedaling

### Post-Ride
- 📊 Review workout compliance
- 💾 Ensure activity synced
- 🧼 Clean trainer and bike
- 📝 Add notes about how it felt

## Advanced Tips

### Optimizing ERG Performance
1. **Find your optimal cadence** - usually 85-95 RPM
2. **Anticipate intervals** - start spinning up 5 seconds early
3. **Smooth transitions** - don't stop pedaling between intervals
4. **Use small ring** - better ERG response for some trainers

### Workout Modifications
- **Too hard?** Reduce workout intensity by 5-10%
- **Too easy?** Increase by 5% or reduce recovery time
- **Time-crunched?** Skip warm-up/cool-down (not recommended regularly)

<Info>
  **Remember**: Consistency beats intensity. Better to complete workouts at 95% than fail at 105%.
