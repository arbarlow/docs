description: Understanding how Stride calculates training stress from your workouts
---

## What is Training Score?

**Training Score (TS)** is Stride's measure of how much training stress a single workout creates. It combines:
- **Duration**: How long you trained
- **Intensity**: How hard you worked
- **Your fitness**: Relative to your FTP or threshold HR

<Info>
  Think of Training Score as the "cost" of a workout - higher scores mean more stress on your body (and more adaptation potential).

## How Training Score is Calculated

### Power-Based Calculation

For rides with power data:

```
Training Score = (Intensity Factor)² × Duration in hours × 100
```

Where:
- **Intensity Factor (IF)** = Normalized Power ÷ FTP
- **Normalized Power** = Weighted average accounting for variability
- **Duration** = Moving time in decimal hours

### Example Calculation

A 2-hour ride with:
- Normalized Power: 180W
- Your FTP: 250W
- IF = 180 ÷ 250 = 0.72
- TS = (0.72)² × 2 × 100 = 104

### Heart Rate-Based Calculation

When power isn't available:
- Uses time in HR zones
- Weighted by zone intensity
- Less precise than power but still valuable

## Training Score Guidelines

### By Workout Type

| Workout Type | Typical TS Range | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Recovery Ride | 20-40 | 1 hour easy spin |
| Endurance Ride | 50-80 | 2-3 hour zone 2 |
| Tempo Workout | 80-120 | 90 min with tempo intervals |
| Threshold Session | 100-150 | 1 hour with FTP intervals |
| Long Endurance | 150-250 | 4-5 hour steady ride |
| Epic/Race | 250+ | Century or hard race |

### By Fitness Level

Same workout, different Training Scores:

| Rider | FTP | 1hr @ 200W | Training Score |
|-------|-----|------------|----------------|
| Beginner | 150W | Very hard | 178 |
| Intermediate | 200W | Threshold | 100 |
| Advanced | 250W | Tempo | 64 |
| Pro | 300W | Endurance | 44 |

<Warning>
  This shows why you can't compare Training Scores between riders - it's relative to YOUR fitness.
</Warning>

## Factors Affecting Training Score

### Increases Training Score
- **Longer duration** (exponential effect)
- **Higher intensity** (squared relationship)
- **More time above threshold**
- **High variability** (intervals vs steady)

### Decreases Training Score
- **Lower FTP setting** (makes same power "harder")
- **Coasting/stops** (only counts moving time)
- **Recovery periods** in intervals

### Doesn't Affect Training Score
- **Total distance** (100 TS could be 50km or 150km)
- **Average speed** (depends on conditions)
- **Elevation gain** (unless it affects power)
- **Weather** (but may affect your power output)

## Normalized vs Average Power

### Why Normalized Power?

Average power doesn't capture the true physiological cost:

**Steady Ride**: 
- 1 hour at constant 200W
- Average Power: 200W
- Normalized Power: 200W

**Variable Ride**:
- 30 min at 100W, 30 min at 300W
- Average Power: 200W
- Normalized Power: ~245W
- Much harder physiologically!

### How It Works

Normalized Power:
1. Calculates 30-second rolling average
2. Raises to 4th power (emphasizes hard efforts)
3. Averages these values
4. Takes 4th root of result

This better represents metabolic cost of variable efforts.

## Using Training Score Effectively

### Daily Targets

Based on your goals and fitness:

| Day Type | Target TS | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Recovery | 0-40 | Active recovery |
| Easy | 40-70 | Aerobic maintenance |
| Moderate | 70-120 | Building fitness |
| Hard | 120-180 | Key workouts |
| Epic | 180+ | Special occasions |

### Weekly Patterns

**Build Week Example** (Load ~70):
- Monday: Rest (0)
- Tuesday: Intervals (100)
- Wednesday: Endurance (60)
- Thursday: Tempo (90)
- Friday: Recovery (30)
- Saturday: Long ride (180)
- Sunday: Endurance (80)
- **Total**: 540 TS

### Progression Over Time

Safe TS progression:
- **Week 1**: 400 total
- **Week 2**: 440 total (+10%)
- **Week 3**: 480 total (+10%)
- **Week 4**: 300 total (recovery)

## Common Misconceptions

### "Higher is Always Better"

**Wrong!** Quality matters more than quantity:
- 100 TS of focused intervals > 150 TS of junk miles
- Recovery rides should be LOW TS
- Chasing high TS daily leads to burnout

### "Same TS = Same Workout"

**Not true!** These could all be 100 TS:
- 3 hours zone 2
- 90 minutes with threshold intervals  
- 2 hours tempo
- 1 hour VO2 max workout

Different adaptations despite same score!

### "I Need High TS to Improve"

**False!** Consistency beats big days:
- 5 × 60 TS (300 weekly) > 2 × 150 TS
- Sustainable training = long-term gains
- Recovery allows adaptation

## Training Score vs RPE

Sometimes perceived effort doesn't match TS:

### TS Seems Too Low
- You may be fitter than your set FTP
- Time to retest
- Or you had a bad day (fatigue, heat, etc.)

### TS Seems Too High  
- FTP may be set too low
- Check power meter calibration
- Normal for very long rides

<Info>
  **Remember**: Training Score is a guide. How you feel matters too. High fatigue with "normal" TS? Rest anyway.
</Info>

## Optimizing Your Training Score

### For Best Results

1. **Accurate FTP**: Test regularly for proper TS calculation
2. **Consistent measuring**: Same power meter ideal
3. **Log all activities**: Include easy rides for complete picture
4. **Monitor trends**: Weekly/monthly TS more important than daily
5. **Balance intensity**: Mix of TS from different zones

### Red Flags

Watch for these patterns:
- TS consistently >150 daily (unsustainable)
- Never exceeding 80 TS (not challenging yourself)
- Huge TS variations (300 one day, 0 the next)
- Only high-intensity TS (no base)
