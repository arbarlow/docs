## Power Curves

Your best efforts across all durations:

**Key Durations**:
- **5 seconds**: Sprint power
- **1 minute**: Anaerobic capacity
- **5 minutes**: VO2 max efforts
- **20 minutes**: Threshold power indicator
- **60 minutes**: True threshold/FTP

## Other Important Metrics

### HRV (Heart Rate Variability)
Day-to-day variation indicates recovery status (synced from Whoop if connected).

### Efficiency Factor
Power divided by heart rate - shows fitness improvements when it increases for same effort.

## Using Metrics Together

The real power comes from understanding how metrics relate:

1. **High Training Score + High Fatigue** = Take a recovery day
2. **Increasing Load + Stable Fatigue** = Good progressive training
3. **Power Curve Improvements** = Training is working!

<Info>
  **Remember**: Metrics guide training decisions but always listen to your body. Feeling terrible with "good" numbers? Rest anyway.
	
	**Think of it this way**: A Training Score of 100 represents roughly the most you could do for 1 hour.
