## The Training Balance

Successful endurance training is about finding the right balance between stress and recovery. Stride helps you manage this balance through three key metrics: **Load** (fitness), **Fatigue** (tiredness and form).

## Load: Your Bank Account

**Load** represents your current load level. Think of it as your "fitness bank account" - the cumulative training you've done over the past 42 days. It is NOT your fitness as other platforms suggest. A higher load does not equal a higher FTP. It's a sign of the long term stress you are putting on your body and what your body is managing.

### How Load Works
- **Calculated from**: a two month exponentially weighted average of Training Score
- **Increases when**: You train consistently
- **Decreases when**: You take time off or reduce training
- **Rate of change**: Slow - takes weeks to build or lose significantly

### Building Load Safely

<Warning>
  The usual rule: Don't increase Load by more than 5-7 points per week to avoid injury and burnout. Some athletes can exceed this, but it's not recommended.
</Warning>

#### Progressive Load Building
- **Week 1-4**: Build slowly, +3-5 Load/week
- **Week 5-8**: Moderate building, +5-7 Load/week  
- **Week 9-12**: Consolidate gains, +2-4 Load/week
- **Week 13**: Recovery week, maintain or slight decrease

### Load Targets by Athlete Type

| Athlete Level | Typical Load Range | Weekly Hours | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Beginner | 20-40 | 3-5 | New to structured training |
| Recreational | 40-60 | 5-8 | Training for fitness/fun |
| Enthusiast | 60-80 | 8-12 | Regular events/races |
| Competitive | 80-100 | 12-15 | Racing seriously |
| Elite Amateur | 100-120 | 15-20 | Podium contender |
| Professional | 120+ | 20+ | Full-time athlete |

## Fatigue: Your Recent Effort

**Fatigue** shows how tired you are from recent training - calculated as your 7-day average Training Score.

### Understanding Fatigue Patterns
- **Spikes quickly**: Hard week = high fatigue
- **Drops quickly**: Easy week = low fatigue
- **Daily fluctuation**: Normal and expected
- **Relative to Load**: Compare to your fitness level

### Fatigue Guidelines

#### Fatigue Relative to Load
- **Fatigue > Load**: You're training hard, building fitness
- **Fatigue = Load**: Maintaining current fitness
- **Fatigue < Load**: Well rested, ready for hard efforts

#### Absolute Fatigue Levels
- **Under 40**: Very fresh, might be detraining
- **40-60**: Normal training, well balanced
- **60-80**: Hard training block
- **80-100**: Very hard training, monitor closely
- **Over 100**: Risk of overtraining, consider rest

## Form: Your Performance Readiness

### Reading Your Numbers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High Load, Negative Fatigue">
    **Situation**: Load 85, Fatigue  -10
    
    **Meaning**: You're fit and training hard. This is sustainable for building fitness.
    
    **Action**: Continue if feeling good, consider easy day if very tired.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Load, Positive Fatigue">
    **Situation**: Load 85, Fatigue +10
    
    **Meaning**: You're fit and fresh. Ready for peak performance.
    
    **Action**: Great time for racing or testing. Don't stay here too long.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low Load, Very Negative Fatigue">
    **Situation**: Load 45, Fatigue -20
    
    **Meaning**: You're doing too much too soon.
    
    **Action**: Reduce training intensity. Focus on consistency over big days.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Strategies

### Periodization Using Load/Fatigue

**Base Phase** (12 weeks)
- Gradually build Load from 50 to 80
- Keep Fatigue between -10 and -20
- Focus on volume over intensity

**Build Phase** (8 weeks)
- Maintain or slightly increase Load
- Fatigue can go to -25 during hard weeks

**Peak Phase** (3 weeks)
- Maintain Load
- Fatigue rises from -15 to +5
- Race ready at end

### Using Form to Guide Training

| Form Range | Training Decision |
|------------|------------------|
| Below -30 | Take rest day, risk of overtraining |
| -30 to -20 | Normal hard training, monitor fatigue |
| -20 to -10 | Balanced training, ideal for most days |
| -10 to 0 | Fresh, good for intervals or testing |
| 0 to +10 | Peak form, race or maintain |
| Above +10 | Too fresh, losing fitness, train more |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building Load Too Fast**
   - Leads to injury or burnout
   - Stick to 5-7 point weekly increase

2. **Chronic High Fatigue**
   - Never recovering properly
   - Include regular easy weeks

3. **Chasing High Form Year-Round**
   - Positive Form means you're not training enough
   - Reserve for important events

4. **Ignoring the Numbers**
   - Feeling terrible with "good" numbers? Rest anyway
   - Numbers guide but don't dictate

## Recovery Strategies

### When Fatigue is Too High
- Take a complete rest day
- Do active recovery (50% FTP or less)
- Reduce workout intensity by 10-20%
- Focus on sleep and nutrition
- Consider massage or stretching

### Planning Recovery Weeks
Every 3-4 weeks:
- Reduce weekly volume by 40-50%
- Keep 1-2 intensity sessions but shorter
- Add extra rest day
- Let Form become less negative

<Info>
  **Remember**: Fitness is built during recovery, not just during training. Respect the recovery process!
