## The Training Balance

Successful endurance training is about finding the right balance between stress and recovery. Stride helps you manage this balance through three key metrics: **Load** (fitness), **Fatigue** (tiredness), and **Form** (readiness).

## Load: Your Fitness Bank Account

**Load** represents your current fitness level. Think of it as your "fitness bank account" - the cumulative training you've done over the past 42 days.

### How Load Works
- **Calculated from**: 42-day exponentially weighted average of Training Score
- **Increases when**: You train consistently
- **Decreases when**: You take time off or reduce training
- **Rate of change**: Slow - takes weeks to build or lose significantly

### Building Load Safely

<Warning>
  The golden rule: Don't increase Load by more than 5-7 points per week to avoid injury and burnout.
</Warning>

#### Progressive Load Building
- **Week 1-4**: Build slowly, +3-5 Load/week
- **Week 5-8**: Moderate building, +5-7 Load/week  
- **Week 9-12**: Consolidate gains, +2-4 Load/week
- **Week 13**: Recovery week, maintain or slight decrease

### Load Targets by Athlete Type

| Athlete Level | Typical Load Range | Weekly Hours | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Beginner | 20-40 | 3-5 | New to structured training |
| Recreational | 40-60 | 5-8 | Training for fitness/fun |
| Enthusiast | 60-80 | 8-12 | Regular events/races |
| Competitive | 80-100 | 12-15 | Racing seriously |
| Elite Amateur | 100-120 | 15-20 | Podium contender |
| Professional | 120+ | 20+ | Full-time athlete |

## Fatigue: Your Recent Effort

**Fatigue** shows how tired you are from recent training - calculated as your 7-day average Training Score.

### Understanding Fatigue Patterns
- **Spikes quickly**: Hard week = high fatigue
- **Drops quickly**: Easy week = low fatigue
- **Daily fluctuation**: Normal and expected
- **Relative to Load**: Compare to your fitness level

### Fatigue Guidelines

#### Fatigue Relative to Load
- **Fatigue > Load**: You're training hard, building fitness
- **Fatigue = Load**: Maintaining current fitness
- **Fatigue < Load**: Well rested, ready for hard efforts

#### Absolute Fatigue Levels
- **Under 40**: Very fresh, might be detraining
- **40-60**: Normal training, well balanced
- **60-80**: Hard training block
- **80-100**: Very hard training, monitor closely
- **Over 100**: Risk of overtraining, consider rest

## Form: Your Performance Readiness

**Form** = Load - Fatigue. It indicates how ready you are to perform.

### The Form Scale

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Training Phase">
    **-10 to -25 Form**: Optimal for building fitness
    - Challenging but sustainable
    - Body adapting to stress
    - Not peak performance
    - Perfect for base/build phases
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Fresh/Recovery">
    **-10 to +5 Form**: Balanced and ready
    - Good for testing
    - Ready for hard efforts
    - Sustainable long-term
    - Ideal for maintenance
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Peak Performance">
    **+5 to +15 Form**: Race ready
    - Peak performance state
    - Not sustainable long-term
    - Use for key events only
    - Will lose fitness if maintained
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Managing Form for Events

#### 3 Weeks Before Event
- Form around -20
- Still building fitness
- High training load

#### 2 Weeks Before
- Form around -10
- Begin tapering
- Reduce volume, maintain intensity

#### 1 Week Before
- Form approaching 0
- Significant volume reduction
- Openers and easy rides

#### Race Day
- Form +5 to +10
- Fresh and ready
- Peak performance

## Practical Application

### Weekly Training Patterns

**Build Week** (Increasing Load)
- Monday: Rest or easy
- Tuesday: Intervals
- Wednesday: Endurance
- Thursday: Tempo/Sweet Spot
- Friday: Rest or easy
- Saturday: Long ride
- Sunday: Endurance
- Result: Fatigue > Load

**Recovery Week** (Absorbing Training)
- Reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain some intensity
- More rest days
- Result: Fatigue < Load

### Reading Your Numbers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High Load, High Fatigue, Negative Form">
    **Situation**: Load 85, Fatigue 95, Form -10
    
    **Meaning**: You're fit and training hard. This is sustainable for building fitness.
    
    **Action**: Continue if feeling good, consider easy day if very tired.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Load, Low Fatigue, Positive Form">
    **Situation**: Load 85, Fatigue 75, Form +10
    
    **Meaning**: You're fit and fresh. Ready for peak performance.
    
    **Action**: Great time for racing or testing. Don't stay here too long.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low Load, High Fatigue, Very Negative Form">
    **Situation**: Load 45, Fatigue 65, Form -20
    
    **Meaning**: You're doing too much too soon.
    
    **Action**: Reduce training intensity. Focus on consistency over big days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Declining Load, Low Fatigue">
    **Situation**: Load dropping from 80 to 70, Fatigue 50
    
    **Meaning**: You're losing fitness from insufficient training.
    
    **Action**: Gradually increase training volume to rebuild.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Strategies

### Periodization Using Load/Fatigue

**Base Phase** (12 weeks)
- Gradually build Load from 50 to 80
- Keep Form between -10 and -20
- Focus on volume over intensity

**Build Phase** (8 weeks)
- Maintain or slightly increase Load
- Add intensity, may see higher Fatigue
- Form can go to -25 during hard weeks

**Peak Phase** (3 weeks)
- Maintain Load, reduce Fatigue
- Form rises from -15 to +5
- Race ready at end

### Using Form to Guide Training

| Form Range | Training Decision |
|------------|------------------|
| Below -30 | Take rest day, risk of overtraining |
| -30 to -20 | Normal hard training, monitor fatigue |
| -20 to -10 | Balanced training, ideal for most days |
| -10 to 0 | Fresh, good for intervals or testing |
| 0 to +10 | Peak form, race or maintain |
| Above +10 | Too fresh, losing fitness, train more |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building Load Too Fast**
   - Leads to injury or burnout
   - Stick to 5-7 point weekly increase

2. **Chronic High Fatigue**
   - Never recovering properly
   - Include regular easy weeks

3. **Chasing High Form Year-Round**
   - Positive Form means you're not training enough
   - Reserve for important events

4. **Ignoring the Numbers**
   - Feeling terrible with "good" numbers? Rest anyway
   - Numbers guide but don't dictate

## Recovery Strategies

### When Fatigue is Too High
- Take a complete rest day
- Do active recovery (50% FTP or less)
- Reduce workout intensity by 10-20%
- Focus on sleep and nutrition
- Consider massage or stretching

### Planning Recovery Weeks
Every 3-4 weeks:
- Reduce weekly volume by 40-50%
- Keep 1-2 intensity sessions but shorter
- Add extra rest day
- Let Form become less negative

<Info>
  **Remember**: Fitness is built during recovery, not just during training. Respect the recovery process!
