    **Account → Integrations** in the Stride web app
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Whoop">

    Enter your Whoop credentials
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize Access">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Strava

The Strava integration is mainly for importing routes, but it also enriches activities with names and descriptions.

### Important: What Strava Does and Doesn't Do

<Warning>
  **Strava does NOT sync your activity data to Stride.** You need Garmin, Wahoo, or the Stride app to record activities.

	Due to Strava API limitations, we've decided to not support Strava activities syncing to Stride. Even before the limitations, Strava heavily manipulated the data and it is looses accuracy. With Garmin, Wahoo etc and fit files, you'll always get the most data possible including things like gear changes, battery information etc
</Warning>

### What Syncs with Strava
- ✅ Activity names
- ✅ Routes for weather information
- ✅ Stride activities upload to Strava (if done via the app)
- ❌ Strava activities do NOT download to Stride

### Why Connect Strava?
1. **Automatic Upload**: Your Stride activities appear on Strava
2. **Workout Names**: Most atheletes add better names to their workouts with Strava.
3. **Route Library**: Access your Strava routes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations">
    **Account → Integrations** in Stride
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Connect for Strava">
    You'll see a warning about what syncs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Understanding">
    Click **Continue** after reading the sync limitations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize on Strava">
    Log in and approve Stride's access
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual File Upload

If you use a device that doesn't integrate directly, you can upload .FIT files manually.

### Supported File Types
- ✅ .FIT files
- ✅ Huge folders of .FIT files

### How to Upload
1. Go to (Import)[https://stride.is/account/import] in Stride
2. Select your .FIT file or data export from a service

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

### Activities Not Appearing
1. **Check Connection Status**: Ensure the integration shows a checkmark
2. **Force Sync**: In the device's native app, manually sync first
3. **Wait 10 Minutes**: Some syncs can take time
4. **Re-authorize**: Disconnect and reconnect the integration

### Missing Data
- Ensure your device is recording all data streams (power, HR, cadence)
- Check that sensors are paired to your device before starting
- Verify the activity uploaded successfully to the device's platform first
