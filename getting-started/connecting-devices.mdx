### Important: What Strava Does and Doesn't Do

</Warning>

### What Syncs with Strava

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize on Strava">
    Log in and approve Stride's access
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual File Upload

If you use a device that doesn't integrate directly, you can upload .FIT files manually.

### Supported File Types
- ✅ .FIT files (recommended)
- ✅ .TCX files
- ✅ .GPX files (route only, no data)

### How to Upload
1. Go to **Activities** in Stride
2. Click **Upload Activity** (cloud icon)
3. Select your .FIT file
4. Wait for processing
5. Edit activity details if needed

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

### Activities Not Appearing
1. **Check Connection Status**: Ensure the integration shows a checkmark
2. **Force Sync**: In the device's native app, manually sync first
3. **Wait 10 Minutes**: Some syncs can take time
4. **Re-authorize**: Disconnect and reconnect the integration

### Missing Data
- Ensure your device is recording all data streams (power, HR, cadence)
- Check that sensors are paired to your device before starting
- Verify the activity uploaded successfully to the device's platform first

### Sync Delays
Normal sync times:
- **Garmin**: 5-10 minutes
- **Wahoo**: 5-15 minutes  
- **Whoop**: Updates every few hours
- **Manual Upload**: Immediate
